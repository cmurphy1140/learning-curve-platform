4. **Event-driven programming** - Contrast with synchronous flow
5. **Functional programming** - Emphasize immutability for React

### Implementation Pitfalls
1. **Bundle size** - Monitor and optimize regularly
2. **Mobile performance** - Test on real devices
3. **Accessibility** - Audit with automated tools

## CLAUDE CODE INSTRUCTIONS

When implementing this project:

1. **Always follow the Arcade UI design system** - Use glass morphism, gradients, and NO EMOJIS
2. **Prioritize educational clarity** - Every component should teach something
3. **Use TypeScript strictly** - Help developers from typed languages feel comfortable
4. **Document extensively** - Comments should explain the "why" not just "what"
5. **Build progressively** - Start simple, add complexity gradually
6. **Test everything** - Educational code must work perfectly
7. **Optimize for learning** - Sometimes verbose code is better if clearer
8. **Follow the folder structure** - Maintain clear separation of concerns
9. **Use Lucide React icons** - Never use emoji characters anywhere
10. **Implement error boundaries** - Turn errors into learning opportunities

Remember: This is an EDUCATIONAL platform. Every line of code, every component, every interaction should help someone learn. Clarity and pedagogy trump cleverness.
